                My name is Phil, welcome to my website. Here I will be showcasing my web development projects as I build
                my portfolio,
                slowly but surely convincing those who visit (and myself) that I actually know what I am doing. You can
                find my contact info and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles on the <em>Contact</em> page.
            </p>

            <p id="p2">
                I graduated from the University of Utah's Web Development Bootcamp in July 2019. Through this program I
                learned
                many skills and technologies, including: JavaScript, React, Express.js, Node.js, jQuery, API/JSON, Ajax,
                HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize, MySQL, Sequelize,
                MongoDB, Firebase, GitHub.
                <!-- I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp through the University of Utah, under the strict
                direction of a
                ruthless leader known only as “Q”. Who might this Q character be? Good question; but this site is about
                me, so take your
                questions elsewhere. -->
            </p>

            <p id="p3">
                Hopefully before too long you will find something on this site worth your time.
            </p>
